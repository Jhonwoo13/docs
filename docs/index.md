# Introduction

Injectify is a web based MiTM tool, similiar to [BeEF](http://beefproject.com/) (although completely unrelated in terms of source code).

## What can it do?

* :zap: Create a reverse Javascript shell between the victim and the attacker.
* :keyboard: Records keystrokes and logs them to a database.
* :closed_lock_with_key: Extract and log [saved passwords](https://twitter.com/thesamdd/status/947251299262836741) from the browser.
