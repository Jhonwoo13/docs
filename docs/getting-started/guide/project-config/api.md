!!! tip
    Your project's API allows you to get a JSON-response of stuff like currently hooked browser, saved passwords and the keylogger keystrokes.

## Accessing the API
If you have permission to access a project, you can simply navigate to the config page and select the appropiate button.

!!! warning
    Do not share the links to your project's API to anyone. They include your GitHub user token, which grants access to information about your account.
