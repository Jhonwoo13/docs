!!! tip
    Roles allows you to control who can access your project and what they can do with it.

## Adding / removing users
If you are an admin or an owner for a project, you can add any user on GitHub (even if they haven't used Injectify before). As soon as they sign in for the first time, they'll be able to access the projects you've gave them access to.
